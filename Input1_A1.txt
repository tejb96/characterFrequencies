Not so long ago, anyone who had heard the word algorithm was almost certainly a computer scientist or mathematician. With computers having become prevalent in our modern lives, however, the term is no longer esoteric. If you look around your home, you will find algorithms running in the most mundane places: your microwave oven, your washing machine, and, of course, your computer. You ask algorithms to make recommendations to you what music you might like or what route to take when driving. Our society, for better or for worse, asks algorithms to suggest sentences for convicted criminals. You even rely on algorithms to keep you alive, or at least not to kill you: the control systems in your car or in medical equipment. The word algorithm appears somewhere in the news seemingly every day.
